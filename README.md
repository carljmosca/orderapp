# A Vaadin TouchKit with Vaadin Spring

This application was cobbled together from a couple of ToucKit examples, one using Spring Boot and the other not.  The
latter of the two had a much nicer look but it's a bit more complex.  The ListBox from the gwt client library is one such example.

For reference the two examples are [Spring Boot](https://github.com/mstahv/vaadin-spring-touchkit) and [Parking Demo](https://github.com/vaadin/parking-demo)

Together I have found these two examples, along with the Vaadin docs, to be very helpful in learning more about TouchKit.
